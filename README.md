# Sample Spring Boot Project for CICD
This is a sample Spring Boot Project which you can use to create CICD and learn to build CICD's.

Try to run Static Code analysis using SonarQube on this project and try to deploy this Project on Docker, Kubernetes etc using Jenkins/ Azure Pipelines / GitLab CICD / Circle CI / Travis CI etc.
